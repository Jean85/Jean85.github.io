      <title>DoctrineMySQLComeBack 3.0.0: DBAL 4 support</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;facile-it/doctrine-mysql-come-back&lt;/code&gt; had a major release last year, and it included a lot of changes to support DBAL 3. Luckily, with DBAL 4, the amount of changes is a lot smaller, mainly signature changes. In short, all the changes done during the last major bump allowed us to not have to do much for this new release.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;May thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/oleg-andreyev&#34;&gt;@oleg-andreyev&lt;/a&gt; for doing the initial work and PR to kickstart this release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DoctrineMySQLComeBack 2.0.0: DBAL 3 support</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;facile-it/doctrine-mysql-come-back&lt;/code&gt; was written long time ago by my colleague Luca Boeri, in an attempt to solve the infamous &amp;ldquo;MySQL server has gone away&amp;rdquo; error, and similar issues. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple Doctrine DBAL driver wrapper that catches relevant exceptions from the driver and attempts to reconnect to the database; this is pretty useful if your PHP script is doing something else between queries, and an aggressive timeout from the database truncates the connection in the meantime, due to the prolonged inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
