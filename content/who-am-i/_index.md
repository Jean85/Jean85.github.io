title: "Who am I"
draft: false
---
I've been a professional developer since 2010, after graduating with a [masters degree in CS at UniCA](http://informatica.unica.it/), the University of Cagliari, but I was always involved with computers, using my first PC (a Pentium 90) at six years old, writing my first lines of code at the age of twelve, and assembling PCs as a side hustle for years after that.

In the first few years after my degree I've worked in C++ on a topographic CAD, with a particular focus on a road design module, but after that I've switched career, and I've embraced my main passion, high-quality **backend PHP** applications.

Working at [Facile.it](https://engineering.facile.it/) since 2014, I've had the possibility to expand my knowledge in Symfony, testing, OOP, Kanban and a lot more. I've also started there my first [open source project](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit) and my first attempts as a [speaker]({{< ref "/talks" >}}).

Using that as a stepping stone, I've started leading a team of remote developers, working on more projects, dabbling with [Docker & Kubernetes]({{< ref "continuous-deployment-from-gitlab-ci-to-k8s-using-docker-in-docker.md">}}), and getting involved with the [PHP-FIG](https://www.php-fig.org/), where I currently hold the role of Secretary. I also help organize the Milano PHP User Group ([PUG MI](https://milano.grusp.org)) since 2017.

Since October 2021 I took the role of Engineering Manager, leading my previous team and three more, covering the Integration area, with a lot of different projects that support all the different business units inside my company.

Since December 2023 I hold the role of Head of Platform, leading Facile.it's Platform Team, which comprises a list of very skillful independent contributors from various specialties, producing tools and helpful standardization for all the other developers in the company.   

### Deserved mentions
For all those fantastic things that I did, and I continue doing in my career, I would like to thank my wonderful wife, for all the love, patience and time which she poured onto me and that allowed me to do everything. My beautiful son, which I am so grateful to have, because he helps me to stay grounded and to love the small things in life. And my late father, a fellow developer, to have instilled in me this passion.
