The PHP ecosystem is very rich and mature, and offers you a lot of stable and widely used tools, frameworks and libraries. Symfony evolved long ago from a monolithic framework into a collection of very useful and reliable components, but one component in particular (in my opinion) really stands out: **Symfony Messenger**. 

In a single package, you have an easy way to dispatch messages and tasks to sync and async handling, with enough abstraction to support a variety of transports natively, and a long list of useful patterns already implemented and ready to be used out of the box.

In this talk, I'll recount how Symfony Messenger successfully replaced a lot of the code that I had to write by hand in the past multiple times, how I successfully used it in different situations, all the features and tricks that you can leverage with it, why it's important to use them and which pitfalls you may encounter using this tool.
