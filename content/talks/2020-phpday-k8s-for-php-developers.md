Docker has slowly won the hearth of many developers as a good, flexible and reliable tool to build local environments for web apps, but containers in production were still a myth for a long time. 

Now, with the advent of Kubernetes (k8s), deploying (PHP) applications with containers is the new shiny tool, but the huge amount of new concepts and technologies scares a lot of people away.

In this talk we will walk through the basic concepts and tools that a PHP developer needs to know about when deploying to a k8s cluster, so that youâ€™ll have enough to understand that this new world is not so scary, and hopefully build your own first automatic deployment.
