Paraunit 0.4.3 has been released! 
<!--more-->
Here's what's changed:

### Changed

*  `--configuration` behaviour is now identical to the same option in PHPUnit: it can accept also a path without a filename,
   and has a `-c` shortcut (default filename is `phpunit.xml.dist`) ([#19]([https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/issues/19]))
* Added `-c` shortcut to README
