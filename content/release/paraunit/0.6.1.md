Paraunit 0.6.1 has been released! The main improvement on the user side is the extension of the Symfony package constraint,
to allow the full 3.x series to be used with! The coverage feature is still in the works, I hope to release 0.7 with it
this summer.

Here's the full 0.6.1 changelog:

### Changed

* Symfony compatibility has been extended to `<4.0`, since Symfony 3.1 has been released; we will rely on [their BC promise](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html)
* A new approach for dockerfiles, now they will be based on the standard Docker PHP library. This will allow for a
faster image build, cleaner dockerfiles and a more precise PHP version targeting, including:
  * `docker/dockerfile-php-5.6` with the related `docker/setup-php-5.6.sh` script that will allow to build a container
  starting from the PHP 5.6 image
  * `docker/dockerfile-php-7` with the related  `docker/setup-php-7.sh` script that will allow to build a container
  starting from the PHP 7.0 image
* Paraunit now adopts [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) as a coding style
  * A `contrib/contributing.sh` has been added to tidy the code style, using `phpcbf`
  * A git pre-commit hook is enabled during the `composer install` command to warn about code style violations
* CONTRIBUTING.md file has been added, with instructions for coding style and usage of Docker images for development
