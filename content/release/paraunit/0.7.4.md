[Paraunit 0.7.4](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/releases/tag/0.7.4) has just been released. This patch version add a simple but very useful functionality, the string filtering of tests.

Full changelog text:

### Changed

* Add optional argument to both commands to filter tests filenames; the filter is case insensitive and doesn't rely on paths, so it doesn't have to be a full or relative path; it can also be used in conjunction with the `--testsuite` option
