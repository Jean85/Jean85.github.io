[Paraunit 0.8](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/releases/tag/0.8) has been released! 
With this release I added the continuous integration: at each Git tag, the Travis build prepares, signs and uploads to the GitHub releases page Paraunit's PHAR. Thanks to [Andreas Heigl](https://andreas.heigl.org/2017/01/19/encrypt-a-build-result-automaticaly/) that made this not only possible, but very straightforward to implement.

 Next phase will be the [1.0 stable release milestone](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/milestone/4), which is probably just a little away. This release paved the way to the PHPUnit 6 support, with the new LogPrinter brought from PHPUnit.

For the list of the other changes of this release, here's the full changelog:

### Changed

* Add support for two additional coverage output format: `--php` and `--crap4j`
* Add support for colored output when using `--text-to-console`: just use the `--ansi` option with it
* Copied and moved the JSON log printer from PHPUnit to Paraunit, to allow further support and better control over the logs
* When printing the file recap at the end of the execution, print the test's FQCN if possible instead of the filename
* Various internal refactoring (DI, configuration, runner, coverage processors)
* Added Continuous Deployment: the PHAR gets built and signed on Travis when tagging, and deployed automatically into a GitHub release (thanks to @heiglandreas for the tips)
