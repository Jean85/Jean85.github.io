With this release, I'm grouping a few fixes and improvements that I collected in the past month. Mainly, I've fixed the `--debug` option and the `--text-to-console` coverage output. Also, now the logo is optional, and at the end of each line it's printed a partial count of executed tests.

Here's the full changelog:

### Added
 * Add official support to PHP 7.2 (added to Travis CI matrix)
 * Add executed tests counter at the end of each line in output (#91)

### Changed
 * The Shark logo is now optional; to show it at the top, use the `--logo` option
 * The `--debug` output has been completely rewritten and now is more useful than ever! 

### Fixed
 * Fix the `--text-to-console` coverage option (#99)
