Paraunit 0.6.2 has been released! This version include a fix in the choice of the dir for the partial test results, that
caused issues while on non-Linux systems. Some minor fix are present too, and now Paraunit shows the right version when
launched.

Also, since this release, all commits by me will be GPG signed!

Unfortunately, the coverage feature is still in the works, but it's slowly going on; the feature is working, but release 
0.7 still needs some polishing. 

Here's the full 0.6.2 changelog:

### Changed

* Binaries moved to the `/bin` dir (#50, thanks @garak)

### Fixed

* Temp dir for storing JSON partial logs now works in non-Linux OS too (#52, thanks @thomasvargiu): it previously used a
wrong dir (`/temp`); now it relies on `sys_get_temp_dir()` as a fallback
* Minor fixes to README.md (#48, #49, thanks @garak)
* Paraunit version is shown correctly now when launching it
