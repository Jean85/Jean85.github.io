I had to release a fast fix for a problem introduced in the 0.12 release, due to the new behavior of the `--text` and `--text-summary` options. At first, it seemed that having an option with an optional argument was impossible, but I was able to do that anyway, and it spured a [PR to the Symfony Docs](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/9560https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/9560) too!

Here's the full changelog:

### Fixed
 * Fix the behavior of the new `--text` and `--text-summary` options ([#121](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/121))
