This time, another release for Symfony 8 compatibility, but a minor one due to pending changes: the `facile-it/symfony-functional-testcase` package drops support for older PHP and Symfony versions, on top of supporting Symfony 8.

This means that next time we'll bump to PHP 8.1 and Symfony 5.4, meaning that the usefulness of this package will wane. Maybe it's time to abandon it?

This is the full changelog:

* Add support for Symfony 8 (#25)
* Drop support for PHP below 7.4 (#15)
* Drop support for Symfony below 4.4 (#15)
