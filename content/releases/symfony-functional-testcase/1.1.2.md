This small patch fixes an issue that arises in Symfony 5.3+, where the command tester fails with this error: `Cannot retrieve the container from a non-booted kernel.`
<!--more-->
The kernel was booted but mishandled by custom boot code done while preparing the command tester, so I fixed it leveraging the dedicated protected method given by the base test case to solve this issue entirely.

This is the full changelog:

* Fix and simplify kernel booting for command tester ([#11](https://github.com/facile-it/symfony-functional-testcase/pull/11))
