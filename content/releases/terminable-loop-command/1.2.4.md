This small new patch was required to fix the compatibility of the package with the newly released Symfony 7.3.
<!--more-->

The bug arose from the fact that, in this new minor release, the Symfony Console `Command` started implementing the `SignalableCommandInterface`, which unfortunately comprehends a `handleSignal` method, whose signature conflicts with our own. This is to be expected, since that signature basically implements the same feature, terminal signal handling.

To be fixed, this required a duplication of the class and a conditional autoload, so I hope to ditch this approach soon by dropping support for older Symfony versions (below 5.2 at least) and rely completely on the Symfony interface. 

This is the full changelog:

* Fix support for Symfony 7.3 ([#23](https://github.com/facile-it/terminable-loop-command/pull/23))
