This new minor release is a maintenance one, which drops support for older (and EOLed) PHP & Symfony versions; this allowed me to bump all the development dependencies and streamline the CI flow.

This is the full changelog:

* Drop support to PHP 7.3
* Drop support to EOL Symfony versions (3.x, 4.0 to 4.3, 5.0 to 5.3)
