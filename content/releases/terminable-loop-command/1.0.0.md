This is the first release of this package! It's Shell+PHP combination to run Symfony console commands in loop under a daemon or Kubernetes, instead of using a long running process.

This package contains a shell script and an abstract Symfony Console Command class; you need to write your command extending that class, and launch it through the shell script. Ideally, the script has to be used as a container entry point, and/or launched with a supervisor, like Docker Compose, Kubernetes, `supervisord`.

Fore more details, you can look up the [project's README](https://github.com/facile-it/terminable-loop-command/).
