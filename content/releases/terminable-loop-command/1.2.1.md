This small new patch was needed because we discovered that PHP official Docker images override the `STOPSIGNAL` directive, using `SIGQUIT` instead of `SIGTERM` when shutting down a container. Thanks to Gabriele Colombera for providing the PR.

This is the full changelog:

* Adds support for SIGQUIT signal (needed to support php-fpm-alpine docker images which overrides STOPSIGNAL ([Official Dockerfile](https://github.com/docker-library/php/blob/master/8.2/alpine3.18/fpm/Dockerfile#L259)))
