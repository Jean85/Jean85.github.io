This new minor release is a consequence of the previous patch: since we needed to use a double approach to support Symfony 7.3+, now we dropped the old one and rely always on the `SignalableCommandInterface`.

In reality this release has a lot of maintenance under the hood, because I took the occasion to upgrade PHPUnit, PHPStan, Psalm, and add Rector & Composer Analyser. All of this means a shiny new package, which is a lot more "up to date" than before!

This is the full changelog:
* Drop support for PHP below 8.2 ([#24](https://github.com/facile-it/terminable-loop-command/pull/24)
* Drop support for Symfony below 6.4 ([#24](https://github.com/facile-it/terminable-loop-command/pull/24)
