This minor release includes a small refactoring that I did months ago (and didn't release yet) where I bumped the minimum required PHP version to 8.1. This allowed me to do some clean up (mainly thanks to Rector) and fix multiple PHP deprecations.
Attached to this, I've also released a fix that intercepts [a new timeout message that MySQL 8.0.24+ spits out under PHP 8.4](https://github.com/facile-it/doctrine-mysql-come-back/issues/107). Many thanks to [@ackermannd](https://github.com/ackermannd9) for reporting it and helping me in the process.

It is also now tested against PHP 8.5 (but it didn't require any changes).

Here's the full changelog:

* Bump minimum PHP version to 8.1
* Intercept new timeout message in MySQL 8.0.24+ under PHP 8.4+ (thanks @ackermannd)
* Test against PHP 8.5
