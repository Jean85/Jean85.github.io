release:
  name: facile-it/doctrine-mysql-come-back
  tag: 3.0.0

This small patch includes the same fix that I released with 2.1.0, [a new timeout message that MySQL 8.0.24+ spits out under PHP 8.4](https://github.com/facile-it/doctrine-mysql-come-back/issues/107). Many thanks to [@ackermannd](https://github.com/ackermannd9) for reporting it and helping me in the process. It is also now tested against PHP 8.5 (but it didn't require any changes).

Here's the full changelog:

* Intercept new timeout message in MySQL 8.0.24+ under PHP 8.4+ (thanks @ackermannd)
* Test against PHP 8.5
