title: "DoctrineMySQLComeBack 3.0.0: DBAL 4 support"
release:
  name: facile-it/doctrine-mysql-come-back
  tag: 3.0.0
---

The `facile-it/doctrine-mysql-come-back` had a major release last year, and it included a lot of changes to support DBAL 3. Luckily, with DBAL 4, the amount of changes is a lot smaller, mainly signature changes. In short, all the changes done during the last major bump allowed us to not have to do much for this new release.

May thanks to [@oleg-andreyev](https://github.com/oleg-andreyev) for doing the initial work and PR to kickstart this release.
