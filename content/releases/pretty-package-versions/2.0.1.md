Below the full changelog:

### Added
* Add `VersionMissingExceptionInterface`, and two exceptions implementing it: `ProvidedPackageException` and `ReplacedPackageException`
### Fixed
* Throw explicit `ProvidedPackageException` when asking for the version of a package which is provided (was `\TypeError` before)
* Throw explicit `ReplacedPackageException` when asking for the version of a package which is replaced (was `\TypeError` before)
