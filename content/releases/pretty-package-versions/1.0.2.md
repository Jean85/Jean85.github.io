Another small issue solved with a small patch, and PHP 7.2 support comes along!
<!--more-->

### Added
 * Add PHP 7.2 to the build matrix for official support
### Changed
 * Require at least `ocramius/package-versions` 1.1.3 to avoid issues when removing the package (see [this issue](https://github.com/Ocramius/PackageVersions/issues/41))
