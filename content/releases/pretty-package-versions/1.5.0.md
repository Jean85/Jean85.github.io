### Added
* Add `PrettyVersions::getRootPackageName` as a compatibility layer to be used in place of `PackageVersions\Versions::ROOT_PACKAGE_NAME`, which would be a transient dependency ([#23](https://github.com/Jean85/pretty-package-versions/pull/#23))
* Add `PrettyVersions::getRootPackageVersion`, a shortcut to `PrettyVersions::getVersion(PrettyVersions::getRootPackageName())` ([#23](https://github.com/Jean85/pretty-package-versions/pull/#23))

### Changed
* Roll back to use `composer/package-versions-deprecated` as in 1.3 (see [#21](https://github.com/Jean85/pretty-package-versions/pull/#21) & [#22](https://github.com/Jean85/pretty-package-versions/pull/#22))
