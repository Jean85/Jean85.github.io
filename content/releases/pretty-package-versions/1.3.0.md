Thanks to the work of the Composer maintainers, `ocramius/package-versions` has been forked to backport support back to PHP 7.0, while maintaining Composer 2 compatiblity. This new version leverages this fork.

### Changed
* Switched dependency from `ocramius/package-versions` to its fork `composer/package-versions-deprecated`, to ensure compatibility with both PHP 7.* and Composer 2 (see [#13](https://github.com/Jean85/pretty-package-versions/pull/13), thanks @dereuromark and @seldaek)
