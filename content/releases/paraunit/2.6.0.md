title: "Paraunit 2.6.0: hide deprecations by configuration"
release:
  name: facile-it/paraunit
  tag: 2.6.0
---
This new release includes the resolution of a [long-standing issue](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/issues/224), which polluted Paraunit's output when too many deprecations were detected. In this new version, Paraunit respects PHPUnit's configuration, which by default does not show the full deprecation text.

Deprecations are detected anyway, so you will still get yellow `D`s and the list of affected tests when appropriate.

This is the full changelog

### Added
* Deprecations details are now shown according to the PHPUnit config [#303](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/303), thanks @garak

NB: the config attribute in the PhpUnit configuration is `displayDetailsOnTestsThatTriggerDeprecations`. Since this value is `false` by default, in this version the deprecations will be hidden. If you want to replicate the previous behavior, set the attribute to `true` in your configuration.
