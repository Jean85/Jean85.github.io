title: "Paraunit 1.3.1: fix option with chunked execution"
release:
  name: facile-it/paraunit
  tag: 1.3.1

This patch, on the old 1.x branch, was prompted by a bug found by a colleague: using `--testsuite` with chunked execution made PHPUnit execute no tests.

Luckily, the bug does not affect the 2.x branch, but I ported the regression test anyway.

Here's the full changelog of the release:

* Avoid passing `--testsuite` option to PHPUnit when running with chunks [#276](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/276)
