I may have jumped the gun while releasing the PHPUnit 11 compat, and I didn't check that the CI was actually installing it. Unfortunately there were multiple dependencies still conflicting with it, and Prophecy needed some PRs to be compatible. I filed them and used them in my CI, so that now the compatibility is checked.

I needed to do multiple changes to make the CI green, but still no code changes was needed, only a widening of `composer.json` constraints and some tests & CI fixes.
