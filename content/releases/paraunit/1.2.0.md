title: "Paraunit 1.2.0: PHP 8 & PHPUnit 9.3 support"
release:
  name: facile-it/paraunit
  tag: 1.2.0
---

This release contains only support for newer versions of PHP & PHPUnit; due to PHPUnit 9.3 requiring a new major version of `phpunit/php-code-coverage`, I'm forced to drop support to all PHPUnit versions below 9.3. Usage of Paraunit is unchanged.
