title: "Paraunit 1.1.0: PHPUnit 9.1 and internal refactor"
release:
  name: facile-it/paraunit
  tag: 1.1.0

As reported [in the previous release](/news/release/1.0.1), I was working on [supporting PHPUnit 9](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/149). Today, PHPUnit 9.1 was released, and so I've released Paraunit 1.1.0, which supports *only* PHPUnit 9.1 and forward: this is due to the fact that the `--printer` option got deprecated, so I have to switch approach to have a working solution for the foreseeable future. In this case, I switched to using `TestHook`, and opted for a small refactor of how Paraunit fetches PHPUnit test results.

Here's the full changelog of the release:

### Added
 * Add support for PHPUnit 9.1 [#149](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/149)
### Changed
 * Large internal refactor from using PHPUnit's `--printer` to `TestHook`s [#149](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/149)
### Removed
 * Drop support for PHP <= 7.2 [#149](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/149)
 * Drop support for PHPUnit <= 9.0 [#149](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/149)
