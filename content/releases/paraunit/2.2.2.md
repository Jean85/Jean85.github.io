This is a small patch to smooth the compatibility with the new release of PHPUnit, 10.4. Previous versions would still work fine, but I took the time to fix all the tests (that were broken due to reliance on `@internal` code such as PHPUnit events) and to add support for the new CLI options regarding the errors baseline.
