title: "Paraunit 2.8.0: PHPUnit 13 support"
release:
  name: facile-it/paraunit
  tag: 2.8.0

With this new minor, we're finally able to support the newly released PHPUnit 13 with Paraunit. This basically required no code changes apart from the `composer.json` constraints and a couple of tests adjustments, as a testament of the reliable integration strategy that I chose when integrating with it.

This release also includes a small PR about notices being reported as specific issues when running tests, which was pending for a while.

This is the full changelog:

* Support PHPUnit 13 [#356](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/356)
* Map notices as new test issues [#305](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/305)
