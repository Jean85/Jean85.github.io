On the same day of [PHPUnit 11.0.0 release](https://phpunit.de/announcements/phpunit-11.html), I'm able to release a minor version of Paraunit that supports it, and [no code change was necessary](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/225)! You may still be impacted by PHPUnit's breaking changes and require to adjust your tests accordingly, but Paraunit can be upgraded before with no hassle (provided that you have at least PHPUnit 10.5.4 already installed), since it's cross-compatible between the two major versions.
