title: "Paraunit 2.7.0: fix abnormal termination detection and add PHPUnit deprecation reporting"
release:
  name: facile-it/paraunit
  tag: 2.7.0
---
This new release includes a couple of improvements: the first one is the addition of PHPUnit deprecation as separate test issues, so that those will be reported in a separate category, as with PHPUnit itself; the second one stems from [some issues detected by PHP-CS-Fixer under PHP 8.5](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/issues/326), where some skipped tests were marked erroneously as "abnormal terminations". I discovered that, when using the `requires` attribute, PHPUnit would report only a `Skipped` event, without the `TestStarted`, `TestPrepared` and `TestFinished` events, which would trigger this issue.

* Reject `--check-php-configuration` PHPUnit option since it doesn't run any test [#325](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/325)
