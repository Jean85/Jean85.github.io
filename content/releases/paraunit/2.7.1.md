This small new patch was triggered by a PR from a new contributor, Kocal, thank you! The fixes needed to make Paraunit compatible with Symfony 8 was a single line change (plus some more in the unit tests), which is impressive since now we support 5 different major versions, all across from 4.4 ([which is EOL](https://symfony.com/releases/4.4)) up to 8.0!

This is the full changelog:

* Add support for Symfony 8 [#344](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/344), thanks @Kocal
