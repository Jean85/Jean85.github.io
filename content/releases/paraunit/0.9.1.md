+++

[Paraunit 0.9.1](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/releases/tag/0.9.1) has been released with a really small improvement: I wnated to show a pretty, short version string in the header, when launching Paraunit. I recently started using Ocramius' package to do it, but it didn't provide that feature, and he was adamant about not implementing it in the future.
  <!--more-->

So I decided to release an OSS package for this usage, `Jean85/pretty-package-versions`, available here: [https://github.com/Jean85/pretty-package-versions/](https://github.com/Jean85/pretty-package-versions/). Feel free to use it in your projects, as I've done inside Paraunit. 

Here's the full changelog:

### Changed
* Use `Jean85\PrettiVersions` to print the version header, and hide the big SHA commit hash when not needed
