This new release comes thanks to a new contributor: thanks [@raffaelecarelle](https://github.com/raffaelecarelle)!

He contributed the support of two native PHPUnit options with [a single pull request](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/273): `--exclude-testsuite` and `--test-suffix`. Both these options allow the user to filter and exclude tests from the execution.
