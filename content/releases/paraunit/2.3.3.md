I got a bug report saying that the Symfony PHPUnit Bridge 6.4.8 and 7.0.8 and higher made test runs with Paraunit fail due to a warning. At first I thought that the Symfony error handler was messing with PHPUnit's again, but in reality it was just making explicit a warning that was already there for ages.

This simple patch avoids generating that warning, and makes your CI green again!
