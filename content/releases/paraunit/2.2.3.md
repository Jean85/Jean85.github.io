This another small patch is to allow using Paraunit with Symfony 7, which was released just yesterday. The [related PR](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/pull/220) needed just to fix a couple of return types. Paraunit should work flawlessly with PHP 8.3 too, which was released a couple of day prior, but I had to revert the additional CI job because [Prophecy is not ready yet](https://github.com/facile-it/paraunit/actions/runs/7044811698/job/19173277683).
