This is the first, stable release of this library that I built on top of [`facile-it/mongodb-bundle`](https://github.com/facile-it/mongodb-bundle/), which allows to use the MongoDB connection provided by the bundle to be used as a Symfony Messenger transport. I build this because I needed the equivalent of the Doctrine transport to store failed messages on a project that didn't use Doctrine, but our OSS MongoDB bundle.

Having to implement this led me to discover the internals of Symfony Messenger, and which such deeper understanding I was able to work better with this tool

First release of this package; features include:
- A Symfony Messenger transport that relies on MongoDB, using [`facile-it/mongodb-bundle`](https://github.com/facile-it/mongodb-bundle/)
- The bundle support to be used in a Symfony app
- An extension point to enrich the persisted document, using the `DocumentEnhancer` interface
- A non-sendable `ReceivedStamp` stamp class dedicated to obtain the ID of the persisted document
- A `RedeliveryStampExtractor` utility class
