This other new minor, released on the same day of the previous one, was needed to release support for PHP 8, since it also required to drop support for PHP 7.2 at the same time. Having two separate releases allows end users to have a smoother upgrade path, and me the possibility to release patches in both minors if needed.

This is the full changelog:
* Allow PHP 8 (#9)
* Drop support for PHP 7.2 (#9)
