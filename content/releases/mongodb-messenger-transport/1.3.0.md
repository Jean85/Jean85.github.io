title: "MongoDB Messenger Transport 1.3.0"
release:
  name: facile-it/mongodb-messenger-transport
  tag: 1.3.0
---

This new minor adds the `resettable` option to the transport, so that you can disable it if you need to inspect the transport during tests. This is due to the fact that under Symfony 5.3, if a service implements the `ResetInterface` (as our transport does), the `reset` method  gets automatically invoked at kernel shutdown, which happens after using the Symfony test client (`KernelBrowser`).

This is the full changelog:
* Force `typeMap['root']` to `BSONDocument` ([#8](https://github.com/facile-it/mongodb-messenger-transport/issues/8))
* Add `resettable` option to add the choice of having a transport that does not implement `ResetInterface` (#10); default is `true` for BC, but it should be a possible fix for tests under Symfony 5.3 that wipe the queue due to that.
