This new, first minor of this package handles two issues coming from the upstream, Symfony Messenger package. In both cases the originating cause was the addition of the new `ErrorDetailsStamp`, which will be the future way to store failure information in messages.

This is the full changelog:
* Adapt behaviour when retrieving last error from stamps due to [symfony/symfony#32904](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/32904) (#5)
* Deprecate `RedeliveryStampExtractor` when using Symfony >= 5.2 due to [symfony/symfony#32904](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/32904) (#5)
