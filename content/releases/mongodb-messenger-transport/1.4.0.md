This new minor should just add support for Symfony 7, but in reality it contains a lot of work. The CI for this library wasn't active for a long time, so a lot of issues and deprecations where making it fail... 
<!--more-->

To solve this I had to do a length PR ([#19](https://github.com/facile-it/mongodb-messenger-transport/issues/19)) to resolve all the deprecations and the issues in the main branch; I also needed to upgrade the CS rules ([#20](https://github.com/facile-it/mongodb-messenger-transport/issues/20)) so that an older PHP-CS-Fixer version wouldn't impede upgrading dependencies, which in turn was making the CI fail too.

In the end, the Symfony 7 PR was small, since all the busywork was done before.

I also had to restrict a couple of return types, which are technically BC breaks, but I hope that no one is extending those classes, and even if they do, the fix is easy and straightforward. 

This is the full changelog:
* Allow Symfony 7 ([#18](https://github.com/facile-it/mongodb-messenger-transport/issues/18))
* Require at least `facile-it/mongodb-bundle` 1.6
* Drop support for PHP 7.3
* Drop support for `ext-mongodb` below 1.6
* Drop support for `mongodb/mongodb` below 1.5
* [minor BC break] `\Facile\MongoDbMessenger\Transport\MongoDbUnresettableTransport::get` return type restricted from `iterable` to `array`
* [minor BC break] `\Facile\MongoDbMessenger\Transport\Receiver::get` return type restricted from `iterable` to `array`
* [minor BC break] `\Facile\MongoDbMessenger\Transport\TransportFactory::createTransport` return type restricted from `TransportInterface` to `MongoDbUnresettableTransport`
