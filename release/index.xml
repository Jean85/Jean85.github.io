      <description> Today I released a new small patch for Paraunit, fixing the support for a hidden dependency (phpunit/php-file-iterator) which broke Paraunit with its 2.0 release.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the full changelog:
Fixed  Allow explicitly phpunit/php-file-iterator 2 #126  </description>

      <guid>http://jean85.github.io/release/paraunit/0.12.1/</guid>
      <description> I had to release a fast fix for a problem introduced in the 0.12 release, due to the new behavior of the --text and --text-summary options. At first, it seemed that having an option with an optional argument was impossible, but I was able to do that anyway, and it spured a PR to the Symfony Docs too!
Here&amp;rsquo;s the full changelog:
Fixed  Fix the behavior of the new --text and --text-summary options (#121)  </description>

      <guid>http://jean85.github.io/release/paraunit/0.12/</guid>
      <description>With this release, I had to do some under-the-hood changes, but we finally support PHPUnit 7; to do that I had to bump the minimum PHP required version to 7.1. I&amp;rsquo;ve also added a better support for text coverage report, adding the possibility of obtaining just the summary report.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the full changelog:
Added  Added support for PHPUnit 7 and phpunit/php-code-coverage 6  Changed  The coverage text output options have changed:  The --text option now accepts a filename as an argument, and defaults to the console as output (replacing --text-to-console) The new --text-summary option behaves in the same way, but it writes only the summary part   Removed  Removed support for PHP 7.</description>

      <description>This releases has nothing big on the outside, but a lot of code rework under the hood. The DI has been completely migrated from YAML to PHP (so no more symfony/yaml) and support for Symfony 4 has been added; also, a small bug has been fixed.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the full changelog:
Added  Added support for Symfony 4  Changed  Migrated the whole DI configuration from YAML to PHP Require at least jean85/pretty-package-versions 1.</description>

      <guid>http://jean85.github.io/release/paraunit/0.10.1/</guid>
      <description> With this release, Paraunit replaces the suggestion of facile-it/paraunit-testcase with dama/doctrine-test-bundle; also there&amp;rsquo;s a new feature that will report any test failure due to deprecation warnings catched by the Symfony PHPUnit Bridge.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the full changelog:
Added  Add support for deprecation warnings found by symfony/phpunit-bridge: failures and tests output are now reported  Changed  Start suggesting dama/doctrine-test-bundle instead of facile-it/paraunit-testcase, since it has been abandoned.  </description>

      <guid>http://jean85.github.io/release/paraunit/0.10/</guid>
      <description>With this release, I&amp;rsquo;m grouping a few fixes and improvements that I collected in the past month. Mainly, I&amp;rsquo;ve fixed the --debug option and the --text-to-console coverage output. Also, now the logo is optional, and at the end of each line it&amp;rsquo;s printed a partial count of executed tests.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the full changelog:
Added  Add official support to PHP 7.2 (added to Travis CI matrix) Add executed tests counter at the end of each line in output (#91)  Changed  The Shark logo is now optional; to show it at the top, use the --logo option The --debug output has been completely rewritten and now is more useful than ever!</description>

      <title>Paraunit 0.9.1: a small fix in the header</title>
      <link>http://jean85.github.io/release/paraunit/0.9.1/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jean85.github.io/release/paraunit/0.9.1/</guid>
      <description>Paraunit 0.9.1 has been released with a really small improvement: I wnated to show a pretty, short version string in the header, when launching Paraunit. I recently started using Ocramius&amp;rsquo; package to do it, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t provide that feature, and he was adamant about not implementing it in the future.
So I decided to release an OSS package for this usage, Jean85/pretty-package-versions, available here: https://github.com/Jean85/pretty-package-versions/. Feel free to use it in your projects, as I&amp;rsquo;ve done inside Paraunit.</description>

      <title>Paraunit 0.9.2 and 0.8.3: missing dependencies</title>
      <link>http://jean85.github.io/release/paraunit/0.9.2/</link>

      <guid>http://jean85.github.io/release/paraunit/0.9.2/</guid>
      <description> Paraunit 0.9.2 and Paraunit 0.8.3 has been released to fix a nasty little bug that I got reported to me: two dependencies were missing and the CI missed that due to the fact that both were required by dev dependencies.
I fixed that and backported the fix to the 0.8 series, since it was very easy to do.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the full changelog:
Fixed  Add missing dependencies: symfony/yaml and symfony/stopwatch  </description>

      <title>Paraunit 0.9: PHP 7, PHPUnit 6 and the pipelines</title>
      <link>http://jean85.github.io/release/paraunit/0.9/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jean85.github.io/release/paraunit/0.9/</guid>
      <description>After a long time and a lot of work, Paraunit 0.9 has been released. This release is a big step ahead: now Paraunit runs with PHPUnit 6, and support to older versions is dropped; this also means that the minimum supported PHP version is now 7.0, and the minimum version of the Symfony components is bumped to 2.7, since older versions are out of support since may.
All these changes brought along a lot of refactoring, and I took the occasion to sprinkle scalar and return types everywhere in the code (see #93); this was also behind a blog post of mine that I wrote in response to the &amp;ldquo;visual debt&amp;rdquo; controversy.</description>

      <guid>http://jean85.github.io/release/paraunit/0.8/</guid>
      <description>Paraunit 0.8 has been released! With this release I added the continuous integration: at each Git tag, the Travis build prepares, signs and uploads to the GitHub releases page Paraunit&amp;rsquo;s PHAR. Thanks to Andreas Heigl that made this not only possible, but very straightforward to implement.
Next phase will be the 1.0 stable release milestone, which is probably just a little away. This release paved the way to the PHPUnit 6 support, with the new LogPrinter brought from PHPUnit.</description>

      <description> Paraunit 0.7.4 has just been released. This patch version add a simple but very useful functionality, the string filtering of tests.
Full changelog text:
Changed  Add optional argument to both commands to filter tests filenames; the filter is case insensitive and doesn&amp;rsquo;t rely on paths, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a full or relative path; it can also be used in conjunction with the --testsuite option  </description>

      <title>Paraunit 0.7.1: coverage in text format</title>
      <link>http://jean85.github.io/release/paraunit/0.7.1/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jean85.github.io/release/paraunit/0.7.1/</guid>
      <description>Paraunit 0.7.1 has just been released; this is just a minor release that adds a new useful feature: the text format for the coverage. You can either use it on screen as an integration tool (see Jenkins, GitLab), or save it as a file. Since there is a small limitation in CLI options handling by the Symfony component, this feature is implemented through two separate options.
In the next versions, I will work to implement the other missing formats, PHP and Crap4j.</description>

      <description> Paraunit 0.7.2 has just been released with a minor fix: colored output has been disabled from text coverage output to console, since it may cause incompatibilities. I will think of a way to re-enable it if possible in later releases.
Full changelog text:
Fixed  Disable colored output in text coverage to console, to avoid issues with GitLab integration.

      <guid>http://jean85.github.io/release/paraunit/0.7/</guid>
      <description>Finally, Paraunit 0.7 has been released! This version includes the long awaited coverage feature: now you can collect your test coverage running your tests in parallel!
Along with this new huge feature, here comes a lot of new fixes and changes: for example, now a lot of default PHPUnit options can be used and they will be passed along to the single PHPUnit processes that Paraunit spawns; also, now we officially support Windows, and we added an Appveyor CI build to do that.</description>

      <description>Paraunit 0.6.2 has been released! This version include a fix in the choice of the dir for the partial test results, that caused issues while on non-Linux systems. Some minor fix are present too, and now Paraunit shows the right version when launched.
Also, since this release, all commits by me will be GPG signed!
Unfortunately, the coverage feature is still in the works, but it&amp;rsquo;s slowly going on; the feature is working, but release 0.</description>

      <description>Paraunit 0.6.1 has been released! The main improvement on the user side is the extension of the Symfony package constraint, to allow the full 3.x series to be used with! The coverage feature is still in the works, I hope to release 0.7 with it this summer.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the full 0.6.1 changelog:
Changed  Symfony compatibility has been extended to &amp;lt;4.0, since Symfony 3.1 has been released; we will rely on their BC promise A new approach for dockerfiles, now they will be based on the standard Docker PHP library.</description>

      <description>Paraunit 0.6 has been released! In the meantime, the coverage feature is being developed on its branch, I hope to have it working soon and release it in 0.7.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s changed in 0.6:
Changed  MASSIVE refactoring of the result output parsing (#31, #33) and the result printing (#37): now Paraunit fetches the tests&amp;rsquo; results using PHPUnit&amp;rsquo;s --log-json option (thanks to @taueres for the idea). This grants a lot of new features:  Parsing of tests results is more robust, it should never fail!</description>
